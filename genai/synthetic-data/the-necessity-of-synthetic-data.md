# The Necessity of Synthetic Data

#### Content Level: 100

### TL;DR

Due to real data scarcity, strengthened privacy regulations, data bias issues, and high data collection costs, synthetic data has become an essential element in AI development. Synthetic data provides unlimited scalability, perfect privacy protection, bias control, and cost efficiency, enabling the development of high-quality AI models.

### 1. The Data Dilemma in Modern AI Development

#### 1.1. Limitations of Data-Driven AI

The performance of modern AI systems is more significantly influenced by the quality and quantity of training data than by the sophistication of algorithms. In a situation where the principle of "Garbage In, Garbage Out" has become more important than ever, many organizations are struggling to secure sufficient amounts of high-quality data. Particularly for new domains or specialized use cases, the required data often doesn't exist at all or is extremely limited.

For example, developing AI for rare disease diagnosis requires medical images and diagnostic records of that disease, but due to the nature of rare diseases, it's difficult to collect sufficient data. Similarly, when trying to develop a customer service chatbot for new financial products, actual customer inquiry data for products that haven't been launched yet simply doesn't exist.

#### 1.2. Practical Constraints of Data Collection

Real data collection involves significant burdens in terms of time, cost, and technical complexity. Large-scale data collection requires massive investments in building data collection infrastructure, deploying specialized personnel, and operating quality management systems. Moreover, correcting bias or incompleteness that may occur during the data collection process is very difficult and costly after the fact.

Particularly in B2B environments or specialized fields, data accessibility is even more limited. Internal corporate data is difficult to disclose externally for security reasons, and data in specialized fields often cannot be collected without the participation of experts in those fields. Due to these constraints, many AI projects are halted due to data shortage or fail to achieve performance targets.

#### 1.3. Global Privacy Regulation Trends

Privacy regulations are being strengthened worldwide, including GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), and domestic personal information protection laws. These regulations impose strict restrictions on the collection, processing, and storage of personal data, and impose massive fines for violations. In the case of GDPR, violations can result in fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is higher.

In this regulatory environment, using actual personal data for AI training is becoming increasingly risky and complex. The requirements that must be complied with continue to increase, including obtaining consent from data subjects, clearly defining data processing purposes, limiting data retention periods, and guaranteeing the right to deletion.

#### 1.4. Limitations of Data Anonymization

Previously, anonymizing personal information was considered a common solution, but recent studies show that anonymized data can still be used to re-identify individuals when combined with other data. Particularly, location data, purchase patterns, and web browsing records have very unique patterns, making complete anonymization nearly impossible. Cases such as the Netflix Prize competition where anonymized movie rating data could be combined with IMDb data to identify individuals, or the New York City taxi data where hashed taxi numbers were reverse-engineered to expose celebrities' travel routes, clearly demonstrate the limitations of anonymization. Due to these re-identification risks, many organizations have become reluctant to use actual data.

### 2. Data Bias and Fairness Issues

#### 2.1. Reproduction of Historical Bias

Real data often directly reflects past social biases and inequalities. For example, AI recruitment systems trained on past hiring data may learn gender or racial biases and make unfair decisions. A representative case is Amazon's AI recruitment tool that was found to discriminate against female applicants and was subsequently scrapped.

In the financial sector, AI systems based on past loan approval data have also caused problems of unfair loan rejections for specific regions or races. Such bias is not merely a technical problem but is recognized as a serious ethical issue that reproduces and amplifies social inequality.

#### 2.2. Sample Bias and Representation Issues

During actual data collection processes, sample bias frequently occurs where specific groups or situations are over- or under-represented. Online surveys may be biased toward young people with high digital literacy, and hospital data may be biased toward patients with the economic means to actually visit hospitals.

Such bias makes AI model performance high only for specific groups while showing significantly lower performance for marginalized groups. A representative example is facial recognition systems showing high accuracy for white males but significantly lower accuracy for women of color.

### 3. Cost and Time Efficiency

#### 3.1. Escalating Data Collection Costs

High-quality data collection involves significant costs. Medical imaging data requiring expert labeling can cost tens to hundreds of dollars per image. Collecting high-quality conversational data for natural language processing also requires several dollars per conversation, and building large-scale datasets can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.

Additionally, considerable manpower and time are invested in post-processing tasks such as data quality management, consistency verification, and error correction. Particularly for multilingual data or specialized field data, securing experts in the relevant language or field is itself difficult and expensive.

#### 3.2. Time-to-Market Pressure

In the modern business environment, fast time-to-market is a core element of competitive advantage. However, traditional data collection methods take months to years, causing businesses to miss opportunities. Particularly in trend-sensitive fields or new technology areas, market conditions may have completely changed by the time data collection is completed.

Synthetic data can significantly alleviate these time constraints. Once appropriate generation models and pipelines are established, the required amount of data can be generated in a short time, dramatically shortening the entire development cycle from prototype development to commercial service launch.

### 4. Innovative Solutions Through Synthetic Data

#### 4.1. Unlimited Scalability and Diversity

One of the biggest advantages of synthetic data is the ability to generate theoretically unlimited amounts of data. While real data collection has limits due to physical and economic constraints, synthetic data can be generated as much as computing resources allow. This is particularly useful for AI technologies like deep learning that require large amounts of data.

Additionally, diversity can be intentionally controlled during the synthetic data generation process. Specific scenarios or edge cases that are lacking in real data can be intensively generated to improve model robustness. For example, for autonomous driving system training, large amounts of data for rare weather conditions or emergency situations can be generated.

#### 4.2. Perfect Privacy Protection

Since synthetic data doesn't contain actual personal information, it's not subject to privacy regulation constraints. This provides innovative solutions particularly in fields dealing with sensitive personal information such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications. While hospitals cannot disclose actual patient data externally, they can collaborate with researchers through synthetic medical data to develop AI diagnostic systems.

Synthetic data also greatly facilitates data sharing and collaboration. While companies find it difficult to directly share data with competitors, they can participate in industry standard model development or benchmarking through synthetic data. This has the effect of accelerating AI technology development across entire industries.

#### 4.3. Bias Control and Fairness Improvement

Bias can be intentionally controlled during the synthetic data generation process. More data can be generated for groups that are under-represented in real data, or balanced datasets can be constructed with historical biases removed. For example, synthetic resume data with equal distribution of gender, race, age, etc., can be generated for recruitment AI training.

Additionally, various scenarios and conditions can be systematically tested, allowing pre-verification of AI system fairness. Model performance for specific groups can be checked in advance, and performance can be improved through additional data generation when necessary.

#### 4.4. Cost Efficiency and ROI Improvement

While initial investment is required to build synthetic data generation systems, once established, these systems can be continuously reused, providing very high cost efficiency in the long term. Particularly by utilizing managed AI services from cloud platforms like AWS, initial investment costs can be significantly reduced. Compared to real data collection, synthetic data generation has a linear cost structure. When data volume doubles, costs roughly double as well, but in real data collection, costs increase exponentially for rarer data. This predictable cost structure greatly improves project planning and budget management.

### Conclusion

Synthetic data provides innovative solutions to fundamental problems faced by modern AI development, including data scarcity, privacy protection, bias, and costs. It's not simply a substitute for real data, but a new paradigm that can generate data with better quality and characteristics. Particularly with the advancement of cloud platforms like AWS, synthetic data generation has become more accessible and cost-effective. In the future, synthetic data will become a standard methodology for AI development, and organizations that effectively utilize it will secure competitive advantages in the AI era. The adoption of synthetic data is not merely a technical choice but an opportunity to fundamentally reconsider an organization's AI strategy and data governance. Through this, faster, safer, and fairer AI systems can be built.
